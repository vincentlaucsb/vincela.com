## Population Distribution of Asian Americans
This map shows the distribution of the population of Asian Americans in the United States. Only towns and cities with a population above 15000 are included. The size of the bubbles depends on the absolute number of Asians 
living in that city. On the other hand, the color (and border width) of the bubbles depends on the percentage of Asians living in that city. As shown on the legend in the upper right, cities with a higher percentage of Asians have a brighter yellow color, while cities with a lower percentage have a paler color. The cuttoff for the different groups was based on standard deviations from the mean percentage of Asians.

## Comments
With the exception of Chicago, the US Asian population appears to mostly be concentrated in cities close to the coast, especially in California.
