<h2>An Exploration of Graph Drawing Algorithms</h2>
<h3>UCSB Math Senior Thesis</h3>
Defined as a collection of nodes and the connections between them (edges),
<strong>graphs</strong> are a mathematical concept that have been appropriated 
by studies ranging from computer science to sociology. One important area of graph theory 
is the study of how to visualize them. In this paper I explore graph drawing algorithms of 
practical and historical interest. This paper is part theory, and part practice as I implement some 
algorithms as C++ programs.

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Below are mostly libraries that I have written for personal projects, but would like to share. Although it is far from an inclusive list of all the code I have written, it represents some of my better work.</p>

        <h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/svg">SVG for C++</a>
        </h3>
        <p>A library which makes it easier to create SVG graphics within a C++ program. It combines a simple API with handy features like calculating bounding boxes.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">CSV Parser</a>
        </h3>
        <p>A multi-threaded C++ CSV parser designed with a simple API. Comes with many useful features, such as type casting and delimiter guessing. Well tested and documented.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/sqlite-cpp">SQLite for C++</a>
        </h3>
        <p>An absolutely terrible wrapper around the SQLite C-API for people who like manually calling <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> every dozen lines. Great for everybody else&mdash;especially for people who like modern C++ features.</p>
