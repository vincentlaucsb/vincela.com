Title: About Me

Authors: Vincent La

Hi! I'm Vincent La and I'm currently working on a Bachelors in Mathematics from the University of California--Santa Barbara. (Math is truly a wonderful subject! However, high school math should probably be considered a form of torture.) Some of my academic interests include data visualization, moral philosophy, logic, and history.

In the outside world (A.K.A. the real world), my interests include football (the one with shoulder pads) and basketball, barbecuing, running, and long walks on the beach.

If you would like to get into contact with me, you may reach me at vincela9@gmail.com (no timeshare offers please) or visit one of my
