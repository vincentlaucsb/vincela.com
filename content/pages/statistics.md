        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This is a collection of analyses and data sets I have collected and cleaned.
        Since the most frustrating and time consuming part of any analysis is cleaning the data,
        I have cleaned the data sets below to the best of my ability. While they still aren't perfect
        (no data is perfect), they are definitely safe for human consumption.</p>
