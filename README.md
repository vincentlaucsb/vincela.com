## Powered by Pelican
My website is generated via Pelican, a static site generator written in Python.

## CSS
My website is laid out according to hand-crafted CSS which you can find [under /themes/vince-theme/](https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/vincela.com/tree/master/themes/vince-theme/static/css-raw). The CSS is itself generated from SCSS stylesheets.

For those of you not in the know, SCSS is a superset of CSS which makes it a lot more tolerable to build stylesheets.
