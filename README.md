## Depedencies
The only dependency of my website is Pelican, a static website generator for Python.

### Okay... I lied a little
Parts of my website, like the interactive UC Salary visualizer are powered by Django and you can find the code for them in their respective repositiories.

## CSS
My website, or at least most of it, is powered by hand-crafted CSS which you can find [here](https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/vincela.com/tree/master/themes/vince-theme/static/css-raw). It is actually written in SASS, which is actually a superset of CSS that makes writing stylesheets tolerable and even... fun. SASS requires a free, open-source compiler which turns your SASS into regular CSS that browsers can interpret.
