Summary: An analysis of severe weather patterns in the United States

## Motivation

This project analyzes severe weather events, focusing on the United States. Some goals of this project are:

 * Revealing changing trends and patterns in weather events
 * Analyzing the severity, frequency, and impact of severe weather
 * Clarifying the connection between climate change and severe weather
 
## Technology

I'm not too crazy on using the "right" software, and am more concerned with informing the public and answering
the questions above. Currently I've heavily used:

 * Python: mainly to process and load data
 * R: dplyr, ggplot2, leaflet
 * PostgreSQL + PostGIS
