## What is this project about?

Every ten years, the federal government sends out a massive task force to collect demographic data about the American people. While this data is available at no cost online, gaining insights from the millions of rows of available data is a huge undertaking. In this project, I will attempt to find some interesting insights by analyzing some of this data. The map above of the population of the United States provides an example of what is possible.
