<p>Welcome to my online collection of Python tutorials. You can expect:
<ul><li>Tutorials friendly to those new to programming...
<li>...or those trying to brush up their Python after a long break</li>
<li>A collection of actual Python code examples with ample explanation
</ul>The writing style was motivated partly by my own personal disatisfaction reading 
long, dry technical works that lacked good examples or interesting practice problems.
 The foreword establishes some conventions used in this book, 
so you won't be confused later. But if you want to dip straight into Python, section 1.2 is
for you. There's also a helpful Appendix at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>The tutorials are provided free of any financial cost. The only thing required from you is time and effort.</p>

<h2 class="section">Introduction: Learning to Walk</h2>
<p>This section will cover the very basics of Python. Regardless of what you are using Python for,
most tasks will be difficult if not impossible without the knowledge contained in this section.</p>
{{ intro }}

<h2 class="section">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of how Python works, we are going to dig 
in deeper and learn the building blocks that will eventually allow us to create 
simple programs.</p>
